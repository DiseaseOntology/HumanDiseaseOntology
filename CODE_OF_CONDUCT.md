# Disease Ontology Knowledgebase (DO-KB) Code of Conduct

## Our Pledge

The DO-KB team pledges to act and interact in ways that contribute to an open, welcoming, diverse, inclusive, and healthy community. The DO-KB team, as members, contributors, and leaders pledge to make participation in our community a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of age, disability, ethnicity, gender identity, level of experience, career stage, education, socio-economic status, nationality, race, color or religion.

## Scope

Here, we outline the DO-KB Code of Conduct as it applies to the DO-KB team, contributors, collaborators, contractors and related projects. We require that the DO-KB Code of Conduct be honored by everyone and every organization that participates in the DO-KB, formally or informally.

This code of conduct should be adhered to by all Disease Ontology personnel, as well as our collaborators. This Code of Conduct applies within all DO-KB community spaces, for submitting GitHub issues or pull requests, posting on DO/DO-KB Facebook, Twitter or Slack channel. Our Code of Conduct also applies when an individual is officially representing the DO-KB community via official email address, posting via an official social media account, or acting as an appointed representative at an online or offline event.

## Our Standard

This DO-KB Code of Conduct outlines the fundamental shared values, ethical standards and norms of our community of contributors and our commitment to creating a welcoming and safe environment for everyone. It is expected that all communications between community members be considerate of the perspectives of others. We aim to support, at all times, constructive discourse when disagreements arise, conducted through collegial discourse, showing respect for each other's perspectives on issues.

The DO-KB strives to be:

- **Welcoming**. We are committed to maintaining a community that welcomes and supports people of all backgrounds and identities. We respect, value and celebrate the unique attributes, characteristics and perspectives that make each person who they are. Drawing on our differences makes us stronger as individuals, and as a community.

- **Collaborative.** The Disease Ontology project and DO-KB welcome any and all contributions, from any individual or project, from any country. We actively seek out and engage with external groups in a transparent way to form meaningful collaborations with a goal of benefiting the scientific community through improvement of one or both of the projects. Questions are encouraged. Nobody knows everything and asking questions early avoids many problems later. We are responsive and helpful, within the context of our shared goal of developing the DO-KB Resources, because we know that we can not truly take advantage of our differences without this knowledge exchange.

- **Respectful.** As a community, to be patient and respectful when dealing with other team members, collaborators, contributors and those seeking assistance. That all communications between community members can be, and should be, considerate of the perspectives of others. Disease knowledge is ever evolving, thus community members offering different perspectives may not always agree. We strive to work together to be open, to hear each other's perspectives, and to resolve conflict constructively, assume good intentions and do our best to act in an empathetic fashion.

We expect our community members to treat others as they wish to be treated, that is by contributing actively to a positive, inclusive environment by:

- Demonstrating empathy and kindness toward other people

- Being respectful of differing opinions, viewpoints, and experiences

- Giving and gracefully accepting constructive feedback

- Accepting responsibility and apologizing to those affected by our mistakes, and learning from the experience

- Focusing on what is best not just for us as individuals, but for the overall community

- Be careful in the words that we choose. We value professionalism in all interactions, and take responsibility for our own speech. We are kind to others. We do not insult or put down others. To be explicit, words and actions that are public (for example, on social media) may still be seen by, or influence, your coworkers. Please be thoughtful and conscientious in your public life as well as your work life.

- Harassment and other exclusionary behavior are not acceptable. This includes, but is not limited to:

  - Violent threats or language directed against another person.

  - Sexist, racist, or otherwise discriminatory jokes and language.

  - Posting sexually explicit or violent material.

  - Posting (or threatening to post) other people\'s personally identifying information (\"doxing\").

  - Sharing private personal content, such as emails or conversations sent privately or non-publicly.

  - Personal insults, especially those using racist or sexist terms.

  - Unwelcome sexual attention.

  - Excessive or unnecessary profanity.

  - Repeated harassment of others. In general, if someone asks you to stop, then stop.

  - Advocating for, or encouraging, any of the above behavior

As a member of the OBO community, we are committed to providing a welcoming and inspiring environment for all community members, and we expect this code of conduct to be honored by each community member ([OBO CoC](https://obofoundry.org/docs/COC.html)).
