# HumanDiseaseOntology
Repository for the Human Disease Ontology (DO).

## Details

DO OBO and OWL files are available in our GitHub repository. The DO provides both the asserted DO is_a hierarchy and inferred versions of our ontology files. [Please review our file README for details.](https://github.com/DiseaseOntology/HumanDiseaseOntology/blob/master/src/ontology/README_DO_Files)

DO website: http://www.disease-ontology.org

DO curation and production moved to OWL, git, and GitHub in November 2015. DO's [SVN repository on Sourceforge.net](https://sourceforge.net/projects/diseaseontology/) has been retired but is still available for historical reference.

A tutorial describing DO's editorial activities is available at:
https://github.com/DiseaseOntology/HumanDiseaseOntology/blob/master/src/ontology/README-editors.md
