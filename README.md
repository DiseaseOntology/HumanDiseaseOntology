# HumanDiseaseOntology
Repository for the Human Disease Ontology (DO).

## Upcoming Change REMINDER!
_Starting with the next release_ of the Human Disease Ontology (expected at the end of May), the prefix for **OMIM cross-references and susceptibilities** will be 'MIM', not 'OMIM'. For details refer to https://github.com/DiseaseOntology/HumanDiseaseOntology/issues/1301. A set of test release files, equivalent to the February DO release with these changes implemented in all production files, is available at https://github.com/DiseaseOntology/HumanDiseaseOntology/tree/mim_test_release/src/ontology.

**_Acronym annotations NOT included_** - DO will start annotating acronyms in a later release (possibly as early as June). A set of test release files, equivalent to the February DO release with _some_ acronyms annotated in all production files, is available at https://github.com/DiseaseOntology/HumanDiseaseOntology/tree/acronym_test/src/ontology.

DO OBO and OWL files are available in our GitHub repository. The DO provides both the asserted DO is_a hierarchy and inferred versions of our ontology files. [Please review our README file for details.](https://github.com/DiseaseOntology/HumanDiseaseOntology/blob/master/src/ontology/README_DO_Files)

DO production has moved to OWL (November 2015).
