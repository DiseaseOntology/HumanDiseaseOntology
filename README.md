# HumanDiseaseOntology
Repository for the Human Disease Ontology (DO).

DO OBO and OWL files are available in our GitHub repository. 
   The DO provides both the asserted DO is_a hierarchy and inferred versions of our 
   ontology files. Please review our README file for details: https://github.com/DiseaseOntology/HumanDiseaseOntology/blob/master/src/ontology/README_DO_Files

DO website: http://www.disease-ontology.org

DO production has moved to OWL (November 2015).
DO will maintain our SVN repository, 
mirroring updates from GitHub on a weekly basis. 

A tutorial describing DO's editorial activies is avaiable at: 
https://github.com/DiseaseOntology/HumanDiseaseOntology/blob/master/src/ontology/README-editors.md
