# Welcome to the Disease Ontology Documentation

This documentation site is intended to provide basic information related to the HumanDiseaseOntology GitHub repository. For more detailed information and other avenues of data access, we invite you to visit the official website of the Disease Ontology at https://disease-ontology.org/. That website contains greater detail about the Disease Ontology project, including statistics and community participation, as well as a browser, SPARQL service, faceted search interface, and API for accessing the data.

For users, this site describes how to make requests to modify the data and about both the production and source files contained in the repository. For editors, various procedures for updating the data in the ontology are available.
