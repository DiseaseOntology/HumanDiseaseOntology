comment: OMIM series 161050. Oddly many of the diseases with the disease title of Nail Disorder, Nonsyndromic Congenital are not included in the OMIM series list, including #1 which has the same ID as the series. #1 is now part of the series (2/13/15).

comment: See description of OMIM 311300. Based on OMIM text I've included 305620 and 309350 in this series. "Frontometaphyseal dysplasia is 1 of 4 otopalatodigital syndromes caused by mutations in the FLNA gene. The disorders, which include otopalatodigital syndrome-1 (OPD1; 311300), otopalatodigital syndrome-2 (OPD2; 304120), and Melnick-Needles syndrome (MNS; 309350), constitute a phenotypic spectrum.".
