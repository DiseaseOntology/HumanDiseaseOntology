DO Ontology files in the DiseaseOntology/HumanDiseaseOntology/src/ontology directory

DO production work, conducted by the University of Maryland team, is done on the 
doid-edit.owl file.

The DO team will update the other files in this directly on a weekly basis.
    This is done by running DO's Makefile. 
    This creates several OWL and OBO version of DO. 
    The DO's primary representation of a disease classification (HumanDO.obo) is represented as a single is_a hierarchy, 
    based on disease etiology. 
    
This README is to document and describe what is found in each file/set of files.

The DO production file was previously named: HumanDO.obo. 
Previous versions of this are archived in DO's SVN directory. 
In the current DO production environment, the HumanDO.obo and HumanDO.owl files are equivalent to the
doid-non-classified.obo and doid-non-classified.owl files produced in this GitHub repository. 

DO Production Ontology Files:
doid-edit.owl           :  DO team editing environment 
                          -- this file is ONLY edited by the DO team. 
                          -- this file currently includes logical definitions to ontology files in the IMPORTS directory.
                          -- DO includes logical definition to: Cell Ontology (CL), UBERON and NCBITaxon

DO weekly data releases in GitHub: produces a suite of files.
    DO content has been enhanced through the inclusion of logical definitions. 

    doid.obo                : --DO's OBO file containing logical definitions
    doid.owl                : --DO's OWL file, containing logical definitions

    doid-non-classified.obo :  DO's single is_a hierarchy (HumanDO.obo), this file does not contain logical definitions
    doid-non-classified.owl :  DO's OWL version, of single is_a hierarchy, this file does not contain logical definitions
    
DO files in the OBO Foundry: 
 The DO provides our single is_a hierarchy as a primary release file to the OBO Foundry.
