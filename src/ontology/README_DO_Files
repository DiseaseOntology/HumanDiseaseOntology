DO Ontology files in the DiseaseOntology/HumanDiseaseOntology/src/ontology directory

DO production work, conducted by the University of Maryland team, is done on the 
doid-edit.owl file.

The DO team will update the other files in this directly on a weekly basis.
    This is done by running DO's Makefile. 
    This creates several OWL and OBO version of DO. 
    
This README is to document and describe what is found in each file/set of files.
The DO production file has been called: HumanDO.obo. 
This file is archived in this directory and in DO's SVN directory. 

DO Production Ontology Files:
doid-edit.owl           :  DO team editing environment 
                          -- this file currently includes axioms to ontology files in the IMPORTS directory.
                          -- DO includes axioms from: Cell Ontology (CL), UBERON and NCBITaxon
                          
doid.obo                : --DO's public OBO file, containing DO axioms
doid.owl                : --DO's public OWL file, containing DO axioms
