The leeches remain attached to their hosts and feed on blood until they become full, at which point they fall off to digest. While feeding, they release an anesthetic and use a combination of mucus and suction to stay attached and secrete an anti-clotting enzyme, hirudin, into the host's blood stream."

The bacterium produces exotoxin called leukotxin which interacts with the host's defense mechanism resulting in tissue damage with charactersistic necrosis, thrombosis, and exudation and the development of pneumonia."

Animals are infected by eating infected meat, by ingestion of feces of a cat that has itself recently been infected, or transmission_by mother to fetus. The symptoms include bilateral, nontender cervical or axillary lymphadenopathy, fever, malaise, myalgia, hepatosplenomegaly, anemia and leukopenia." [url:http\://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toxoplasmosis]
