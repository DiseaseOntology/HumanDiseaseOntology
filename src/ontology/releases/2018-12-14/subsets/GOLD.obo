def: "A gastrointestinal system disease described as the condition of having frequent loose or liquid bowel movements. Acute diarrhea is a common cause of death in developing countries and the second most common cause of infant deaths worldwide.

Along with water, sufferers also lose dangerous amounts of important salts, electrolytes, and other nutrients. There are at least four types of diarrhea: secretory diarrhea, osmotic diarrhea, motility-related diarrhea, and inflammatory diarrhea." []
