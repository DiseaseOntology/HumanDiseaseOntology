comment: This disease may be obsoleted in the future. Diseases previously classified as neurofibromatosis 2 (DOID:0111252) and neurofibromatosis 3 (DOID:0070480 and DOID:0070481) have been reclassified by international consensus as subclasses of schwannomatosis. For details refer to definition sources for neurofibromatosis 1 (DOID:0111253).
