## Overview

Over a single year, the Human Disease Ontology (DO) was accessed by researchers from more than 125 countries, with more than one quarter speaking a language other than English. To meet the emerging needs of the DOâ€™s diverse user community and to support equitable health care and precision public health, the DO is being translated into multiple languages, starting with Spanish.



## Files

Translations are stored in TSV files in the `src/ontology/translations/` directory.

Ontology (OWL) files with translations are available with the release files in the `src/ontology/releases/translations/` directory. While these _can_ be accessed directly, we **_strongly recommend_** these be accessed using their persistent URLs (PURLs).

- **doid-es.owl**: Spanish text only (soon, the 2025-01-29 release includes English placeholders for terms not yet translated).
	- PURL: http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/doid/translations/doid-es.owl
- **doid-international.owl**: International version of the DO with original English and all currently translated text.
	- PURL: http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/doid/translations/doid-international.owl


## Spanish Translation Process

Spanish translation of the DO was initiated in 2023

### Identifying Content

- Compiled a detailed list of website pages/content for translation.
- Confirmed translation accuracy with [The Spanish Group](https://thespanishgroup.org/), specializing in medical term translations.
- Obtained estimates and reviewed translation samples for quality assurance.

### Translation Process

- Created detailed documents for translations outlining specifics covering all live webpages of the DO in a [translation key](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1DTKwKr6AYSiLsTmnKavtKN6b52xJM0Kp3LTh1bxxknc/edit#gid=0) for manual review and future implementation.
- Implemented translations using the [translation key](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1DTKwKr6AYSiLsTmnKavtKN6b52xJM0Kp3LTh1bxxknc/edit#gid=0) for accuracy and consistency.
- Translations are programmatically verified via Google Translate by adding the Google Translate function for Google Sheets to the adjoining column (e.g., `=googletranslate(A2, "en", "es")`), translating the word in the A2 cell from English to Spanish.
- Vetted and verified Spanish terms are integrated into the DO via a ROBOT formatted template that defines the data types to be loaded.

### Testing Translations

- Tested a specific [DO branch for accuracy](https://drive.google.com/drive/u/0/folders/1dYVyHm5ZR4-sBGX3f8HUMbB1QTktxtol) obtained from DO-KB SPARQL.
- Used the Disease Ontology [SPARQL Sandbox](https://disease-ontology.org/do-kb/sparql) to query 'physical disorders' (DOID:0080015) and obtain the DOID, name, definition, and synonym data.
- Conducted two separate SPARQL queries: one for labels & definitions and another for synonyms.

## Translation-to-Ontology Workflow

Conversion of translated text from standardized TSV to OWL ontologies files is primarily accomplished by ROBOT using templates. The workflow involves the following steps:

1. **Source Files**: The source TSV files for the translations are located in the `src/ontology/translations/` directory.
2. **ROBOT Templates**: Generate ROBOT templates to facilitate the translation process.
3. **Translation**: Apply translations to create the final ontology files.
4. **Products**: The final translated ontology files are stored in the `src/ontology/releases/translations/` directory.
